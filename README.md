# Arcade_project-The-interior
The goal of this project was make realistic modern flat like enviroment.
Unfortunatelly the files were too big so I canÂ´t uploud it here on GitHub so I put here Drive link for download.
Here are the files in my drive, blend as well as stl.

The the second problem I lost the textures, I can search some similiar on internet but it would take another hour..,
and you would have to still put them on the models in blender manually and thats lot of work for just one project, so on the end is final render and I the files are on the Drive , hope thats enough.
And if is something wrong with this documentation please write me on the Hack club slack I wil be glad to fix something.
Sessions are marked as numbers...
1.In my first session I modeled the basic layout and make some other preparation for the project.

2.Then I modeled and textured the modern table and made carpet with particle system for more detail.

3.Then I realised that my firs layout is too compilaced for this project so I choose easier one, that looks like open cube.
And I made carpet and sitting bags with particle system, but then I had to delete all particle systems because the file had around 1GB and that was a much.

4.For the fourth session I started making more details I modeled a modern looking lamp and found on internet, nice plant stand which I dowloaded and put textures on that.

6.The next step was configuring the layout little bit , adding more lammps  and I added paintings on the wall for more life to my scene.

7.Then I finalized the scene I removed one plant stand and modeled and textured the cabinet by the walls.

8.For the last session I baked the light and set the render settings as good as possible and placed the camera.
